# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Threat Detection Documentation Chatbot
This project features an intelligent chatbot designed to provide comprehensive information and assistance related to advanced threat detection systems. Leveraging the power of Generative AI, this chatbot is equipped to answer questions, explain concepts, and clarify methodologies based on a specialized knowledge base.

# ðŸ§  Knowledge Base
The chatbot has been trained on detailed reports covering various aspects of cybersecurity threat detection. It can provide assistance and insights related to:

Hybrid Network Anomaly Detection System: Understanding the architecture, synergy of Isolation Forest and Autoencoder models, and the end-to-end prediction process.

Anomaly Detection for Web Server Logs: Explaining the Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) approach, feature engineering, data scaling, and threat prediction in web traffic.

DDoS Attack Detection and Culprit Identification System: Detailing the two-phase system for detecting DDoS attacks (model training with Random Forest) and identifying sources from network traffic.

Insider Threat Detection Systems: Describing the unsupervised machine learning approach using Isolation Forest for detecting insider threats, including model training, threat detection, and reporting.

# âœ¨ What it Can Help With
The chatbot can provide detailed explanations on:

Machine Learning models (Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, Feedforward Neural Network, Random Forest).

Feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques.

Threat detection methodologies and concepts (DDoS, Insider Threats, Network Anomalies).

Specific terminology related to network security and AI in cybersecurity.

The prediction and analysis processes for each described system.

# ðŸš€ How to Run
To start the chatbot, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and execute the main application file:

## Bash
### npm i
### node merlin.js
